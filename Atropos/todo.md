TODO

[ ] Figure out namespace/solution/project strategy
[ ] Explode Discrete/Categoricals into columns
[ ] Custom labels for Discrete features (ex: "Class 1", "Class 2 or 3")
[ ] Check categorical exploding: n cases -> n-1 columns? How about unknown values?
[ ] Explode: how should I handle unexpected but not missing values?
[ ] Configuration for various algorithms
[ ] Metrics (RMSE, Precision, ...)
[ ] Verbose/Quiet mode?
[ ] Reporting
[ ] Real-time update on convergence etc...?
[ ] Algorithms: use functions, or classes?
[ ] Utilities for standard operations, ex: normalization
[ ] Can I automatically normalize labels on Logistic?
[ ] Build in k-fold
[ ] Build in feature importance analyzis using random perturbation
[ ] What should a classifier return? Class, Classes + Probabilities?
