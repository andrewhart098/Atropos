# Atropos

## Goal

Facilitate the creation of machine learning models in F#, focusing on

* simplifying features definition,
* providing adapters to classic algorithms.

## Status: experimental / pre-release.

Currently exploring possible APIs; expect breaking changes.

## Contributing

Given the current status, the API is expected to change and be broken regularly for now. For that reason, we are mostly interested at that point in API suggestions, or use cases that should be considered. Code contributions are also highly welcome, but given the current unstability, we will probably be merging rather conservatively.
